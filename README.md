Appendix - Data Analysis For Capstone

This repository contains the computational appendix for the capstone on narratives and storytelling. The Jupyter Notebook provides a transparent and reproducible analysis of the experiment I underwent to explore the impact of allegorical storytelling on nature connectedness.
The data was gathered from two different surveys, which represented the controlled (called 'Allegory') and non-controlled groups (called 'WWF').
